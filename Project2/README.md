README

This README file describes the structure of my Mini Project 2 folder and provides brief explanations of the contents of each file and subfolder, including the data corpus, scripts, and visualizations.

Corpus

This folder contains all datasets used in the project. It includes the original table downloaded from the 2021 Rosstat Census; the parsed table containing only Tajik migrant data; a translated version of the table from Russian into English; an aggregated table; a cleaned aggregated table prepared specifically for the choropleth map; and a separate table used for analyzing migration purposes.


Scripts

This folder contains all scripts created during the data-processing stage, including both working and non-working versions. Scripts that function correctly are labeled with the prefix working_script, while scripts that produced errors are combined into a single file labeled not_working_scripts. This structure reflects the iterative nature of the data-cleaning process.

Visualizations

This folder includes all visualization outputs generated for the project, saved as HTML files. Successful visualizations are labeled with the prefix Final, while earlier or unsuccessful attempts are labeled as Try_000.
