The Borno and Old Kanembu project is a digital collection that provides access to one of the earliest written sub-Saharan languages in manuscript form. These manuscripts are written in Arabic script, and the corpus originated from Quranic manuscripts that photographed by David Bivar in 1950s. This collection was donated to SOAS library in 2003. The digital collection covers around 400 years starting from the oldest manuscripts found by Bivar (17t to 18th centuries) up to later manuscripts produced in the late 20th century. 
 The Barno and Old Kanembu manuscript project has a strong connection with the three components of Drucker: materials, processing and presentation. 
 The project has a rich material component, which includes analogue sources such as Qur’anic manuscripts, bilingual (Arabic and Old Kanembu) manuscripts, photographs, microfilms, and fieldwork materials, all of which were digitised to create a large corpus of digital folios.
In term of processing component, the project made the digital materials usable through activities such as the transcription and linguistic analyses to study the Old Kanembu language, as well as organising the manuscripts by geographic origin, dates and scripts.
Finally, the digital project made the collection accessible via online platforms such as the SOAS Digital Library portal. It has become easy for users to view the images and metadata and to access the continuously updated collection. It also supports researchers in searching and exploring manuscripts that span over four centuries. 
In short, the digital Borno and Old Kanembu project demonstrates all three Ducker’s stages, Materials+Processing+Presentation, in an integrated way.

I can insert images, if I put them in the `images` folder, and add a link to the image in my post.

## Formatting

I can add subtitles, like the one above. 

For a new paragraph, I press Enter twice.
If I press Enter only once, the text will be displayed on the same line as the previous one.

Lists are very easy: they can be unordered, like this:

* first item
* another item

If you prefer ordered lists, simply use numbers instead of asterisks:

1. first item
2. a second item
