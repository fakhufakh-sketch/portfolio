Good news! I have now finalised Mini Project 2, a Digital Humanities project that examines the spatial distribution of Tajik migrants across Russian regions using official migration statistics. The project resulted in clear and informative visualisations, including a choropleth map and a stacked bar chart, which reveal both regional concentration and differences in migration purposes.
