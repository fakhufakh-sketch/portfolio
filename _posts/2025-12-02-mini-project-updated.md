Proposed Mini-Project: Which destination do Tajik migrants choose within Russia, and what factors influence these destination choices?  

<!--more-->

For this mini-project, I plan to analyse a small corpus of 50- English-language news articles and reports published between 2015 and 2024 that discuss Tajik migrants moving to Russia for work. 
The project focuses specifically on identifying the main destination chosen by Tajik migrants within Russia.
I also aim to explore whether the media evidence supports my hypothesis that Moscow is the primary destination for Central Asian migrants, including those from Tajikistan.

To build this corpus, I will draw on the sources listed below, which include official organisations and reputable news outlets that publish reports and analysis on migration patterns from Tajikistan to Russia.

* IOM UN Migration Tajikistan  https://tajikistan.iom.int

*	BBC News – Tajikistan section  https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvjp2jg0p6dt/tajikistan

* Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty – Tajikistan https://www.rferl.org/tajikistan

*	EurasiaNet Migration Category https://eurasianet.org/search?keywords=Tajik+women+migrant+in+Russia

*	World Bank Migration https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/migration

*	Asian Development Reports https://www.adb.org/search0?keywords=Women+migration
  
*	Springer Nature Link – https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S207997052460032X?utm_source=chatgpt.com

I will search these sites keywords such as “Tajik migrants Russia,” “labour migration Tajikistan,” “Central Asian migration,” “migration,” “migrants’ life in Russia,” and “migrant domestic workers Russia,” “main destination within Russia.” 
After selecting the texts, I will create a small dataset including the article title, publication date, source, link, author, word count, extracted locations mentioned in the article and full text.

My thesis project focuses on women’s migration from Tajikistan to Russia, and this mini-project examines a specific aspect of that topic: how migrants’ main destinations within Russia and how it represented in English-language media and reports by international organisations. 
I am particularly interested in where Tajik migrants relocate within Russia and where they find employment. 
While my main thesis research question asks, “What are the key push and pull factors influencing women’s migration from GBAO, Tajikistan, to Russia (Moscow), and how does this migration affect their post-migration lives?”, this mini project narrows the focus to destination choice. 
In this sub-question, I also consider gender dynamics, as many women migrate to the same destinations as their husbands, and their own settlement decisions are often shaped by family migration patterns.

I expect several possible challenges during this project:

*	Limited number of articles - Tajik women migrants are not widely covered in global news, so the corpus may be small.
  
*	Bias in media representation - International outlets may focus more on dramatic or negative stories.
  
* Cleaning the text - News articles contain advertisements, captions, and metadata that must be removed.
  
* Language variation - Some reports might include transliterated names and locations from Tajik or Russian, which may confuse automated tools.
  
* Text Cleaning - Articles often include advertisements, captions, or metadata that must be removed before analysis.

* Linking Destinations to Factors - Some articles may mention cities but not explain why migrants choose them, requiring careful qualitative coding.

* Metadata inconsistencies – Some articles may not include publication dates or author names, requiring standardisation.
  
In short, this mini project provides a focused examination of how English-language media represent the destination chosen by Tajik migrants in Russia. Although the corpus is small, analysing where migrants are reported to settle and the factors associated with these choices offers valuable insight into the human decision underlying migration. 
The project contributes meaningfully to my broader thesis by highlighting how specific locations and their related opportunities or challenges are framed within media narratives.
