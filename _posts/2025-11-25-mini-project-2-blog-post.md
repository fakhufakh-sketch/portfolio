Proposed Mini-Project: A Qualitative Exploration of Life Trajectories, Motivations, and Transnational Experiences of Tajik Women Migrants in Russia.

Research Question

What are the key push and pull factors influencing women’s migration from GBAO, Tajikistan, to Russia (Moscow), and how does this migration affect their post-migration lives?

For this mini-project, I plan to analyse a small corpus of 5-10 English-language news articles published between 2015 and 2024 that Discuss Tajik women migrating to Russia for work. 

* IOM UN Migration Tajikistan  https://tajikistan.iom.int

*	BBC News – Tajikistan section  https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvjp2jg0p6dt/tajikistan

* Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty – Tajikistan https://www.rferl.org/tajikistan

*	EurasiaNet Migration Category https://eurasianet.org/search?keywords=Tajik+women+migrant+in+Russia

*	World Bank Migration https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/migration

*	Asian Development Reports https://www.adb.org/search0?keywords=Women+migration

I will search these sites keywords such as “Tajik women migrants Russia,” “female labour migration Tajikistan,” “Central Asian women migration,” “women migration,” “migrants’ life in Russia,” and “migrant domestic workers Russia.”
After selecting the texts, I will create a small dataset including the article title, publication date, source, link, and full text.
My thesis project focuses on Women Migration from Tajikistan to Russia, so this mini-project explore how this migration represented in English-language media.

I am particularly interested in whether the media focuses on factors such as what motivates women to migrate, why they choose specific destinations, who the women migrating are, the difficulties they face in the host country, how migration influences their economic, social, and overall quality of life, and what factors affect their decision to remain in the host country. To explore this, I will use basic digital text analysis methods suitable for beginners. I will start with word frequency counts to identify the most common terms and create a word cloud to visualise the main themes. I will also use keyword-in-context (KWIC) to examine how key words such as “women,” “migration,” and “Russia” are used in context, and perform simple theme counts to track topics like work, family, discrimination, or opportunities. These methods will help reveal patterns and highlight how media represents Tajik women migrants.

I expect several possible challenges during this project:

*	Limited number of articles: Tajik women migrants are not widely covered in global news, so the corpus may be small.

*	Bias in media representation: International outlets may focus more on dramatic or negative stories.

* Cleaning the text: News articles contain advertisements, captions, and metadata that must be removed.

* Language variation: Some reports might include transliterated names and locations from Tajik or Russian, which may confuse automated tools.

Despite these challenges, I believe this corpus is manageable for a beginner-level digital analysis and meaningful for my thesis topic.
